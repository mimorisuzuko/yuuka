# WIP: yuuka

A CSS-in-JS that works in server and client Components implemented with `@emotion/serialize` and `stylis`. This package name is inspired by [Yuuka Hayase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_stK_fFXQI).

## Usage

Can write [any emotion object-styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/object-styles) in `css`.

```tsx
<div css={{
    color: "red"
}}>
    Yuuka
</div>
```
